---

## Executive Summary

Veriflo combines three powerful features in one app: **Invoice Extraction**, **Workflow Automation**, and **AI Chat**. Built for ecommerce sellers and finance teams who waste hours on manual data entry, repetitive tasks, and copying data into ChatGPT. Veriflo keeps everything in one place—extract, automate, and analyze without leaving your workspace.

## 1. Invoice Extraction

### What It Does
- Upload PDF invoices or receipts
- AI extracts structured data (Invoice Number, Date, Total Amount, Vendor Name, Tax Amount, PO Number, custom fields)
- Bulk process multiple documents at once
- Review and verify extracted data before export
- Export to Excel/accounting-ready format

### Why Users Should Use It
- **Zero manual entry** — No typing numbers from PDFs into spreadsheets
- **Fewer errors** — AI extraction reduces typos and missed fields
- **Faster reconciliation** — Get invoice data into your books in seconds, not hours
- **Custom fields** — Add any field you need (e.g., PO Number, Cost Center)
- **One place** — Invoices and spreadsheets live together; no juggling tools

### Pros & Benefits
| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Speed | Process dozens of invoices in minutes instead of hours |
| Accuracy | AI reads and extracts; you verify once instead of typing twice |
| Flexibility | Choose which fields to extract; add custom fields on the fly |
| Bulk support | Upload multiple PDFs; process all at once |
| Export ready | Structured data ready for QuickBooks, Xero, or your own sheets |

### Why It's Better Than Other Apps
- **vs. Separate OCR tools** — No need for one tool to extract and another to organize; Veriflo does both
- **vs. Manual entry** — No copy-paste from PDF to Excel; AI does it in one step
- **vs. Generic document AI** — Built for invoices: knows Invoice Number, Vendor, Total, etc. out of the box

### Efficiency Gains
- **Before:** 5–10 min per invoice (open PDF → type into sheet → double-check)
- **After:** ~30 seconds per invoice (upload → AI extracts → quick verify)
- **Rough savings:** 80–90% less time on invoice data entry

## 2. Workflow Automation

### What It Does
- **Record once, run on any file** — Perform actions (sort, filter, enrich, formula, delete rows/columns) while the app records your steps
- Save as a reusable workflow
- Run the same workflow on new files with one click
- Supports: sort, filter, enrich (AI adds data to a column), formulas, delete rows/columns, format

### Why Users Should Use It
- **No code** — Record what you do; the app turns it into a repeatable workflow
- **Same workflow, any file** — Monthly report? Data cleanup? Run it on new data without redoing steps
- **One-time setup** — Build a workflow once; use it forever
- **Scheduled feel** — Run workflows when you need them; no babysitting

### Pros & Benefits
| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| No coding | Record actions; no scripts or formulas to write |
| Reusable | One workflow for monthly reports, data transforms, bulk processing |
| Flexible | Works on spreadsheets and extracted invoice data |
| Enrichment | AI can add info to columns (e.g., categorize vendors, add metadata) |
| Fast | Run complex multi-step workflows in seconds |

### Why It's Better Than Other Apps
- **vs. Zapier/Make** — No complex setup; record in-app, run in-app
- **vs. Excel macros** — No VBA; record clicks and actions
- **vs. Separate tools** — Same app as extraction and chat; no integrations to manage

### Efficiency Gains
- **Before:** Repeat the same 10 steps every month (sort, filter, enrich, export)
- **After:** Run one workflow; done in seconds
- **Rough savings:** 95%+ less time on repetitive data tasks

## 3. AI Chat

### What It Does
- Chat with your data in plain English
- Ask questions like "What is the top selling product?" or "Analyze sales by region"
- AI can run analysis and generate charts
- **@mention files** — Reference multiple files in one question
- Data stays in your workspace; no copy-paste to ChatGPT

### Why Users Should Use It
- **No formulas or code** — Ask in English; get answers and charts
- **Context preserved** — Chat history and file context stay in the app
- **Multi-file analysis** — Mention files with @ to combine data in one query
- **Charts & insights** — AI can create visualizations from your data
- **Secure** — Data doesn’t leave your workspace for external AI tools

### Pros & Benefits
| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Natural language | "What's my total spend by vendor?" — no SQL or formulas |
| In-workspace | Data stays put; no copy-paste to ChatGPT |
| Multi-file | @mention files to analyze across spreadsheets |
| Charts | Get bar charts, pie charts, trends from a simple question |
| Context | Full chat history; AI remembers your data and questions |

### Why It's Better Than Other Apps

- **vs. BI tools** — No complex setup; ask and get answers
- **vs. Excel formulas** — No learning curve; ask in plain English

### Efficiency Gains
- **Before:** Export data → paste into ChatGPT → lose context → repeat next time
- **After:** Ask in the sidebar; get answers and charts in seconds
- **Rough savings:** Instant insights vs. 10–30 min per analysis
